# r-websocket
example of web socket

# Installation

## Install visualizer

Install visualizer at localhost. By now I only clone this repo. You must allow cross origin request, so be sure of configuring the http.conf correctly (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29150384/how-to-allow-cross-domain-request-in-apache2)
the visualizer must be lauched with http://localhost...

## Install R

Install R 3.6 or later

## Run R-plumber

From the root folder of this project run:

``` R
  Rscript Main.R
```

## Run web page example

1. Go to http://localhost:8080/visualizer/src/index.html. The visualizer already comes with the API

2. Paste the content of view.json using the button: "Paste View"

3. Click the "send script" button of the "R script" module


Do you undestand how it works??
